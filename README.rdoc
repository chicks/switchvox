== SUMMARY: 

Ruby Gem for interacting with Digium's Switchvox PBX via JSON

== DESCRIPTION:

Ruby Gem for interacting with Digium's Switchvox PBX via JSON.

There wasn't a gem out there, so I wrote one.

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* The response hash gets converted into a Ruby object, via Hash#to_obj method.

== SYNOPSIS:

  require 'switchvox'
  switchvox = Switchvox::Base.new("pbx.foo.com", 'user', 'password', {:debug => false})

  # Pull the software version of Switchvox
  switchvox.request("switchvox.info.getSoftwareVersion")

  # Pull a call report
  call_log = switchvox.request("switchvox.callLogs.search", {
    "start_date"  => "2010-01-01 00:00:00",
    "end_date"    => "2010-01-02 23:59:59",
    "account_ids" => [1001],
  })
  calls = call_log.calls.call
  calls.each do |call|
    c = call.to_obj
    puts calls.index(call).to_s + ": " + c.start_time + ": " + c.from + " " + c.to
  end

  # Methods that require a file upload can be submitted with the upload method
  upload = switchvox.upload("switchvox.file.add", {
    "file"  => "/path/to/file.ext"
  })

  upload = switchvox.upload("switchvox.images.add", {
    "image_file"  => "/path/to/file.ext",
    "image_type"  => "profile"
  })

== REQUIREMENTS:

* json gem
